# ToDoList
This repository contains a simple application with basic CRUD operations. The main features it covers are:
•	A table to store user details and can send the username and password in request header for simplicity but in real scenario I would prefer .Net core identity
•	LINQ to DB to query on database or transactions but in ideal case I would prefer CQRS (Mediatr for command and Dapper for query)
•	Very little logging, but can be leveraged
•	MVC architecture to make simple
•	SQLite; AspNetCoreInMemory Database
•	Session to store user information
